	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the 
		amount of time an algorithm takes 
		to complete as a function of the size 
		of its input. It helps us understand how 
		efficiently an algorithm runs when the input
		grows large. Time complexity is usually expressed 
		using Big O notation (like O(1), O(n), O(n²), etc.),
		which describes the upper bound or worst-case scenario 
		of the algorithm’s running time. For example, if an algorithm has
		O(n) time complexity, it means that the time it takes increases 
		linearly with the size of the input.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>, on the other hand, measures the
		total amount of memory or space required by an algorithm
		to execute completely. This includes the memory used by input data,
		variables, recursion stacks, and temporary storage. Like time complexity,
		it’s also represented using Big O notation. For instance, an algorithm with 
		O(1) space complexity uses a constant amount of memory regardless of input size,
		while O(n) means memory usage increases linearly with input. Together, time and 
		space complexity help in comparing and
		choosing the most efficient algorithm for solving a problem.</p>
