	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task. As a programmer, your goal should reduce the time complexityof the code by optimizing it and make it more efficient</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is related to the amount od memory occupied by the program.For Example, if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space complexity of the program  becomes O(n)</p>
