	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the 
		amount of time an algorithm takes 
		to complete as a function of the size 
		of its input. It helps us understand how 
		efficient an algorithm runs when the input.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>, on the other hand, measures the
		total amount of memory or space required by an algorithm
		to execute completely. while O(n) .</p>
